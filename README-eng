How to get the token

Now go to "https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer". Be sure that the name of your bot is shown in the top right of the page, near the writing "App". Now click under that written, on "Get Token" and click on "Get page access token". A new dialog box will be open. Choose to continue with your Facebook profile. Choose your facebook page that you want to use. Allow the bot to manage your Facebook page. Now you will see all your Facebook pages.
